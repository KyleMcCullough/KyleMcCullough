Making the GUI messager itself required quite a bit of thinking as it was my first time doing anything like it. 
It introduced me to many new concepts, some I'm sure that weren't the best implementation. I spent quite alot
of effort making sure the end product was as good as possible as evidenced by my high marks for it, but there is defintely
still some room for improvement. 

The Windows form part of the project is good the way it is, it could use some slight adjustment to make it better looking but nothing major.
I feel like the way I handled the events could have been streamlined to make it both cleaner and more efficent. I also didn't really plan 
much out before starting the development process, which would have been better in the long run as it just would've saved a bit of time.

But in general, I am happy with the finished product even if it is a little rough around the edges.
